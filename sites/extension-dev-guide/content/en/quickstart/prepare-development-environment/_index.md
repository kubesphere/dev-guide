This section describes how to build a development environment for extensions. Before you start, make sure KubeSphere Core and related development tools are installed.

* KubeSphere Core: the minimal core component of KubeSphere, which provides a basic runtime for extension development.

* Development tools: On your server, you need to install development tools such as create-ks-project and ksbuilder, and third-party tools such as Node.js, Helm, and kubectl. These tools are used to create a project, install dependencies, provide a runtime environment for extensions, and package and release extensions.


## Install KubeSphere Core


1. Log in to a server on which Kubernetes is installed, and run the following commands to install KubeSphere Core by using `Helm`:

   ```bash
   helm upgrade --install -n kubesphere-system --create-namespace ks-core  https://charts.kubesphere.io/main/ks-core-0.4.0.tgz --set apiserver.nodePort=30881 --debug --wait
   ```

   {{%expand "If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster available, you can expand the current content and quickly create a cluster in the following way." %}}

   ```bash
   curl -sfL https://get-kk.kubesphere.io | sh -
   ./kk create cluster --skip-pull-images --with-local-storage  --with-kubernetes v1.25.4 --container-manager containerd  -y
   ```

   {{% /expand%}}


2. Run the following command to check the pod status. When the pod status is `Running`, you can use the default account and password (admin/P@88w0rd) to access the KubeSphere web console through NodePort (IP:30880). You can also access KubeSphere API Server through NodePort (IP:30881).

   ```
   kubectl get pod -n kubesphere-system
   ```

   If the pod is not running properly and you cannot locate the problem, [submit an issue](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/issues) or [post the issue in the forum](https://kubesphere. io/forum/).


## Install development tools

1. You need to install the following development tools:

   1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) v16.17 or later and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) v1.22 or later.

   2. Install [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) v3.8 or later and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/zh-cn/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) v1.23 or later.

   3. Download [ksbuilder](https://github.com/kubesphere/ksbuilder/releases) to `/usr/local/bin`.

2. Copy the [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/zh-cn/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) configuration file of the Kubernetes cluster to the development host to ensure that the cluster can be accessed by using kubectl.


   ```bash
   âžœ  ~ kubectl -n kubesphere-system get po
   NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
   ks-apiserver-7c67b4577b-tqqmd            1/1     Running   0              10d
   ks-console-7ffb5954d8-qr8tx              1/1     Running   0              10d
   ks-controller-manager-758dc948f5-8n4ll   1/1     Running   0              10d
   ```
