For development based on `React`, if our application contains multiple pages, it is necessary to configure route settingns for the application. Routing can be viewed as the mapping between access paths and React components. In our extension development, routing can be used as follows:

## Principles

KubeSphere 4.0 adopts [react-router V6](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6) for frontend routing. To make route registration easier, KubeSphere adopts `Route Object`. Example:
```javascript
let routes = [
    {
      path: "/",
      element: <Layout />,
      children: [
        { index: true, element: <Home /> },
        {
          path: "/courses",
          element: <Courses />,
          children: [
            { index: true, element: <CoursesIndex /> },
            { path: "/courses/:id", element: <Course /> },
          ],
        },
        { path: "*", element: <NoMatch /> },
      ],
    },
  ];
```

In some cases, you need to insert or replace new routes to existing routes. In such a scenario, you need to specify `parentRoute` as the parent route. For example, if you want to add a route to the left menu of the cluster management page, you first find the corresponding route definition in the ks console source code. In `packages/clusters/src/routes/index.tsx`, find the following code:

```javascript
const PATH = '/clusters/:cluster';

const routes: RouteObject[] = [
  {
    path: '/clusters',
    element: <Clusters />,
  },
  {
    path: PATH,
    element: <BaseLayout />,
    children: [
      {
        element: <ListLayout />,
        path: PATH,
        children: [
          {
            path: `${PATH}/overview`,
            element: <Overview />,
          },
          ...
```

To add a route in `Overview`, use the following code:

```javascript
const PATH = '/clusters/:cluster';

export default [
  {
    path: `${PATH}/demo`,
    element: <App />,
    parentRoute: PATH,
  },
];
```
In the preceding code, `parentRoute` indicates the parent route path of `Overview`.

## Route registration

After you run `yarn create:ext` to initialize a directory for your extension, the `routes` directory is generated by default. The directory structure is as follows:

```shell
└── hello-world
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── README.md
    ├── package.json
    └── src
        ├── App.jsx
        ├── index.js
        ├── locales
        │   ├── en
        │   │   ├── base.json
        │   │   └── index.js
        │   ├── index.js
        │   └── zh
        │       ├── base.json
        │       └── index.js
        └── routes
            └── index.js
```
You can define a route in `routes/index.js`, and then register the route in the entry file of the extensionn. Example:

```javascript
import routes from './routes';  // Import the route file
import locales from './locales';  

const menu = {
  parent: 'topbar',
  name: 'hello-world',
  link: '/hello-world',
  title: 'HELLO_WORLD',
  icon: 'cluster',
  order: 0,
  desc: 'SAY_HELLO_WORLD',
  skipAuth: true,
};

const extensionConfig = {
  routes,
  menus: [menu],
  locales,
};

globals.context.registerExtension(extensionConfig);
```
