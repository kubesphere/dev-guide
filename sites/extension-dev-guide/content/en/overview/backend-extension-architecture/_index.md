description: Describes how to extend the backend API of KubeSphere.

Built on K8s, KubeSphere is highly configurable and extensible like K8s. In addition to extending KubeSphere capabilities with the help of the [K8s extension mechanism](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/), KubeSphere offers a more flexible way to extend its capabilities.

`ks-apiserver` is the API gateway for KubeSphere, offering unified authentication, authorization, and request proxy capabilities. By using the aggregation layer of ks-apiserver, you can extend KubeSphere API as follows:

### Authentication and Authentication

KubeSphere supports unified user management and API authentication, as well as a multi-tenant system and [role-based access control](../../feature-customization/access-control/). These capabilities can be easily reused when extending KubeSphere API.

### Request Proxy

KubeSphere's aggregation layer supports unified proxy forwarding for extensions, which can be simply configured to forward requests into a cluster, outside a cluster, or a managed Kubernetes cluster. View the [API Extensions](../../feature-customization/extending-api/) section for more information.
